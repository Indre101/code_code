    <p>Born in Italy in 1955, Donatella Versace grew up with two major fashion influences:
      her mother was a dressmaker and her older brother, Gianni Versace, was a budding designer. She went
      to work for her brother in the late 1970s, serving as his muse and adviser. Donatella Versace became
      the designer for the company's Versus line in the 1980s.
      After her brother was murdered in 1997, she became artistic director of the Versace Group.</p>

    <h5>Versace's Husband & Family </h5>
    <p>Versace married former model Paul Beck in 1986. The couple had two children together,
      Allegra (b. 1986) and Daniel (b. 1989), before divorcing. Their son was named after a song by Elton John,
      a close family friend. Known for her wild partying lifestyle, Versace battled drug addiction after her brother's
      death. "I couldn't stand the pain," she told Vogue. "I had to hide my feelings. What better way to hide your
      feelings than with drugs?"
      After struggling with cocaine addiction for many years, Versace sought treatment in 2004.
      Allegra Versace

      As part of Gianni Versace's will, Donatella's daughter Allegra was given 50 percent of the company's stake. When
      she turned 18 in 2004, Allegra inherited her claim, an estimated $500 million. She currently serves as a company
      director and is also a theatrical dressmaker residing in New York City.
