    <p>My professional background is a combination of customer service, marketing 
    and as much IT as it was involved in the process. After finishing my Bachelor degree, 
    I felt that I wanted to emerge myself more into a business part, so thatâ€™s what I did. 
    I worked in the environments where the main goal was to sell, to market and provide 
    excellent customer service. These jobs taught me a lot about responsibility, 
    how to accept criticism, how to be critical towards myself and how important it is to
     work towards my goals. Constant interaction with 
    customers, taught me a lot and gave me confidence and needless to say my social skills 
    evolved greatly as well. 
    </p>
    <p>I feel very passionate about learning what multimedia design and communication consist 
    of, but I am concerned about better and faster evolvement in this professional area. 
    That is why, I am choosing this Academy Profession Degree programme, where the 
    curriculum is well and logically structured, where practical knowledge is strongly 
    emphasised, where I know I would be getting necessary knowledge and skills, from 
    competent teachers and methods that have been tested through time. Furthermore studying 
    among international 
    students is one the best ways to stimulate mind and is definitely beneficial 
    in the professional development.
